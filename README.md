In this assignment, we will use loan data from kaggle to predict whether a loan is healthy or not. Note that there are three files. There is a main file and two supplementary files. The first supplementary file shows 'proof' or 'output' of our best 'feature' selection and best 'hyperparameter' selection algorithms for a random forest model that we use later on in this main file (that supplementary file took about 18 hours to run and required Colab Pro's resources). Note that this file should only take 15 minutes to run (at a maximum) and does not exceed Colab's 12GB ram requirement. We ensured that this would happen in this file by using a sample of the dataset (300K rows rather than >1.6MM rows) for our analysis. However, in a second supplementary file, we run this main file (excluding one of the models) on the entire dataset (we used Colab Pro to effectuate this). The model outputs are similar regardless of whether we use a sample of the data-set (or) the entire data-set.
